### About Me:

Hi. My name is Aleksey. I am 19 years old. For a long time I want to become a frontend developer, but there was not enough time for full-fledged studies. Now I've adjusted my schedule, signed up for a course, and will try to learn. My goal is to learn the discipline, to communicate with people of interest. After the course I would like to try to find a job in my specialty.

### Skills:

- Git, GitHub
- VS Code
- HTML5, CSS3
